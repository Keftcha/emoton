## Seeing messages
### The TL (timeline)
The TL is where you can see all your messages and messages of users you follow. It's like the user home screen.
### On profile
#### Self profile
An user can see all message he wrote and he like on his profile. However, other users can't see liked message by the user.
#### Other user profile
An user can see all messages of another user wrote on the profile of that other user. But the user seeing the profile can't see messages the other user liked.

## Follow friends
All user can follow an other user. When users follow each other, they are becoming friends.  
When an user follow another one, all messages of the followed user are displayed in the TL of the user which follow.  
An user can see who he follow and who is his friends, but other users can't.

## Fav message
All user can fav a message. That just mean the user like it.  
The user will be able to see all messages he fav but other user can't.  
The author of the message can see how many people fav it but not who.

## Emotes reaction
All user have acces to the 50 defaults emotes of the web site.  
They also can add their own emotes. Only the user which add the emote can use it to react on message.  
Users are limited to add 50 emotes (that mean they can use 100 emotes, 50 of the website, 50 of them).  
All user can react to any message with one of an emote the have.
